/**
 * Programmer: Mike Boyle
 * Date: 2022-03-10
 * Purpose: Header file for ListIterator class
 * ListIterator allows a client to iterate through a DoublyLinkedList.
 *
 * NOTES:
 * A ListIterator is meant to point to the nodes of an external linked list.
 * It is not meant to hold its own copy of that list.
 *
 * For these reasons, clients should keep the following in mind:
 * 1. If the underlying linked list that the iterator points to is destroyed,
 * reassigned to a new list, or goes out of scope while the ListIterator remains
 * in scope, this will cause errors and other problems.
 * 2. Deleting a node in the list may also cause problems
 * if the iterator happens to be pointing to the deleted node at that time.
 * 3. Therefore, clients should not delete the underlying list or list nodes while the current iterator exists
 * 4. It is better to ensure that the iterator is deleted (or goes out of scope) before
 * doing any destructive operations on the list.
 * 5. Because the ListIterator is not meant to keep "its own copy" of the underlying list,
 * I have not implemented copy constructor, operator= overloads, or special destructor logic.
 * The default behavior of those methods is what is desired here.
 *
